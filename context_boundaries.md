# Context and Boundaries Documentation

## What We Have Built

### Project Overview
We have built a **comprehensive AI Customer Support Agent for Aven**, a fintech company that offers HELOC-backed credit cards. This is a full-stack application that uses advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to provide accurate, contextual responses to customer inquiries about Aven's financial products and services.

### Core Functionality
- **Intelligent Chat Interface**: A ChatGPT-style conversational interface with professional Aven branding
- **RAG-Powered Responses**: Uses Pinecone vector database to retrieve relevant context and OpenAI GPT-4 for natural language generation
- **Knowledge Base Management**: Comprehensive system for processing, embedding, and querying Aven's support documentation
- **Real-time Communication**: Seamless chat experience with typing indicators and smooth animations
- **Professional UI/UX**: Clean, responsive interface optimized for customer support scenarios

### Key Features Implemented
‚úÖ **Text-based Chat System** with natural language processing  
‚úÖ **Vector Database Integration** for semantic search capabilities  
‚úÖ **OpenAI GPT-4 Integration** for intelligent response generation  
‚úÖ **Knowledge Base Loading** from Aven's FAQ and support documentation  
‚úÖ **Rate Limiting and Security** middleware for production readiness  
‚úÖ **Responsive Material-UI Design** with Aven brand colors (white/black theme)  
‚úÖ **Chat History and Session Management** for continuous conversations  
‚úÖ **Smooth Animations and Transitions** for enhanced user experience  
‚úÖ **Error Handling and Fallback Systems** for reliability

### Component Interactions

#### 1. **Frontend Layer (React)**
- **Chat Interface**: Main user-facing chat component with message display
- **State Management**: React Context for global chat state and message history
- **API Service**: Abstraction layer for backend communication
- **UI Components**: Modular components for sidebar, input, typing indicators, and message bubbles

#### 2. **Backend API Layer (Express.js)**
- **Route Handlers**: RESTful endpoints for chat and admin operations
- **Chat Service**: Orchestrates the RAG pipeline and response generation
- **Knowledge Service**: Manages document processing, embedding, and retrieval
- **OpenAI Service**: Handles GPT-4 API calls and response formatting
- **Pinecone Service**: Vector database operations and semantic search

#### 3. **External Service Integration**
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4 for chat completions and text-embedding-3-large for document embeddings
- **Pinecone Database**: Vector storage and semantic similarity search
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against API abuse and cost management

### Data Flow

1. **User Input** ‚Üí Frontend captures message and sends to backend
2. **Context Retrieval** ‚Üí Backend queries Pinecone for relevant knowledge base entries
3. **Response Generation** ‚Üí OpenAI GPT-4 generates response using retrieved context
4. **Response Delivery** ‚Üí Backend sends formatted response back to frontend
5. **UI Update** ‚Üí Frontend displays response with animations and updates chat history

## System Boundaries

### What Is Included (Internal Components)

#### ‚úÖ Core Application
- **Complete Chat Interface**: Full conversational UI with Aven branding
- **RAG Implementation**: End-to-end retrieval-augmented generation system
- **Knowledge Base**: Processed Aven FAQ and support documentation
- **API Layer**: All necessary endpoints for chat and admin operations
- **State Management**: Complete frontend state handling and persistence
- **Security Middleware**: Rate limiting, CORS, input validation

#### ‚úÖ Development Infrastructure
- **Build System**: Configured for both development and production
- **Environment Management**: Configuration for different deployment environments
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and usage instructions
- **Testing Setup**: Jest configuration and basic test structure

### What Is External (Dependencies)

#### üîå Third-Party Services
- **OpenAI API**: External service for LLM capabilities
  - Used for: Chat completions and text embeddings
  - Boundary: We send prompts/text, receive responses/embeddings
  
- **Pinecone Database**: External vector database service
  - Used for: Vector storage and similarity search
  - Boundary: We send queries/vectors, receive search results

#### üîå External Libraries and Frameworks

- **Output**: AI-generated responses and system status information
- **Storage**: Vector embeddings in Pinecone, no persistent user data storage
- **Processing**: Text processing, embedding generation, and semantic search

### Scalability and Limitations

#### Current System Limits

- **Database Scaling**: Pinecone handles vector database scaling automatically
- **Caching**: Could add Redis for response caching and session storage
- **CDN Integration**: For frontend asset delivery and performance optimization

## Security and Privacy Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API abuse and controls costs
- **Input Validation**: Basic sanitization of user inputs
- **CORS Configuration**: Controlled cross-origin resource sharing
- **Environment Variables**: Secure API key management

### Privacy Boundaries
