      "category": "About Aven Card",
      "question": "Is Aven a credit card or a home equity line of credit?",
      "answer": "It is both! Aven is a home equity line of credit that customers access through a credit card. Aven cardholders can use their Aven Card wherever VISA cards are accepted. Aven cardholders can transfer cash directly from their Aven account to another bank account – it is called a CashOut. There may be a one time fee of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance. To transfer balance from a high interest credit card to the Aven card, cardholders can request a balance transfer (BT) to their credit card."

    {
      "category": "Rates and Fees",
      "question": "Is the rate variable?",
      "answer": "The Aven Card is a variable rate credit card. Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven's control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change."

      "category": "Payments",
      "question": "How are payments calculated for fixed installment plans?",
      "answer": "Aven offers fixed payment plans that amortize over several years, details being in the account agreement.

    },
    {
      "category": "Payments",
      "question": "How do you compute my minimum due every month?",
      "answer": "For revolving balance plans, the minimum monthly payment is 1% of the principal plus the monthly interest rate on the outstanding balance. For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount is the same every month. If an account has multiple plans, each plan's minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account."
    },
    {
      "category": "Payments",
      "question": "Is there a prepayment penalty?",
      "answer": "There is no prepayment penalty on an Aven Card account. Cardholders can pay more than the minimum due each month, make extra lump-sum payments, or make a full payoff payment. If a Cardholder intends to payoff an account, the funds must be sent through wire transfer. If any other method of funding is used, there will be a 60 day wait period before the lien is released."

    {
      "category": "Interest and APR",
      "question": "How is interest calculated on the Aven account?",
      "answer": "Interest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. For purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. For Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed."

Balance Transfers and Cash Outs are not eligible for cashback rewards. They can redeem points from the reward redemption page of the app. Once rewards are redeemed they will show up as statement credit. Cashback rewards cannot be used to meet the minimum payment due."
