      "title": "What is a HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit)?",
      "content": "A HELOC is a revolving line of credit that allows homeowners to borrow against the equity in their home. Unlike a traditional loan, a HELOC works like a credit card where you can draw funds as needed up to your credit limit, pay it back, and borrow again. The credit limit is typically based on the appraised value of your home minus any outstanding mortgage balance.",

    {
      "title": "How HELOC Interest Rates Work",
      "content": "HELOC interest rates are typically variable, meaning they can change over time based on market conditions. Most HELOCs are tied to the prime rate, which is influenced by the Federal Reserve's federal funds rate. When the prime rate changes, your HELOC rate will adjust accordingly. Some lenders may offer fixed-rate options for portions of your HELOC balance.",

      "title": "HELOC vs Home Equity Loan",
      "content": "A HELOC provides flexible access to funds with variable interest rates, while a home equity loan gives you a lump sum with fixed interest rates. HELOCs are better for ongoing expenses or projects with uncertain costs, while home equity loans are ideal for one-time expenses with known amounts. Both use your home as collateral.",

    {
      "title": "Tax Benefits of HELOC",
      "content": "Interest paid on a HELOC may be tax-deductible if the funds are used to buy, build, or substantially improve the home that secures the loan. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 suspended the deduction for HELOC interest used for other purposes through 2025. Always consult with a tax professional for guidance specific to your situation.",

      "title": "HELOC Draw Period vs Repayment Period",
      "content": "HELOCs typically have two phases: the draw period (usually 5-10 years) where you can access funds and make interest-only payments, and the repayment period (usually 10-20 years) where you pay both principal and interest. During the draw period, you have flexibility in how much you borrow and repay.",
