### Component Interactions

#### 1. **Frontend Layer (React)**
- **Chat Interface**: Main user-facing chat component with message display
- **Voice Components**: Vapi-powered voice chat with real-time transcription
- **State Management**: React Context for global chat state and message history
- **API Service**: Abstraction layer for backend communication
- **UI Components**: Modular components for sidebar, input, typing indicators, and message bubbles

#### 2. **Backend API Layer (Express.js)**
- **Route Handlers**: RESTful endpoints for chat, admin, and Vapi operations
- **Chat Service**: Orchestrates the RAG pipeline and response generation
- **Knowledge Service**: Manages document processing, embedding, and retrieval
- **OpenAI Service**: Handles GPT-4 API calls and response formatting
- **Pinecone Service**: Vector database operations and semantic search
- **Vapi Service**: Voice chat integration with assistant management and function calling

#### 3. **External Service Integration**
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4 for chat completions and text-embedding-3-large for document embeddings
- **Pinecone Database**: Vector storage and semantic similarity search
- **Vapi API**: Voice conversation management and real-time transcription
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against API abuse and cost management

### Data Flow

#### Text Chat Flow:
1. **User Input** → Frontend captures message and sends to backend
2. **Context Retrieval** → Backend queries Pinecone for relevant knowledge base entries
3. **Response Generation** → OpenAI GPT-4 generates response using retrieved context
4. **Response Delivery** → Backend sends formatted response back to frontend
5. **UI Update** → Frontend displays response with animations and updates chat history

#### Voice Chat Flow:
1. **Voice Input** → Vapi captures and transcribes user speech
2. **Function Call** → Vapi triggers knowledge search function via webhook
3. **Knowledge Retrieval** → Backend searches Pinecone and formats voice-optimized response
4. **Voice Response** → Vapi synthesizes speech and delivers to user
5. **Real-time Updates** → Frontend displays transcription and call status

### Enhanced Backend Architecture

#### **Non-Blocking Startup Process**:
```
Server Startup (1-2 seconds)
├── Express App Initialization
├── Middleware Setup (Security, CORS, Rate Limiting)
├── Route Registration (Chat, Admin, Vapi)
├── Server Port Binding
└── Async Service Initialization
    ├── Vapi Assistant Creation (with timeout)
    ├── Knowledge Base Verification
    └── Health Check Endpoint Activation
```

#### **Service Initialization Flow**:
```
initializeServices() [Non-blocking]
├── Check Vapi Configuration
├── Initialize with 30-second timeout
├── Create/Verify Assistant
├── Log Detailed Progress
└── Enable Voice Features
```

- **Storage**: Vector embeddings in Pinecone, no persistent user data storage
- **Processing**: Text processing, embedding generation, semantic search, and voice transcription

### Scalability and Limitations

#### Current System Limits
- **Concurrent Users**: Limited by Express.js single-thread and API rate limits
- **Knowledge Base Size**: Currently ~45 documents, expandable within Pinecone limits
- **Response Time**: Dependent on OpenAI, Pinecone, and Vapi API response times
- **Context Window**: Limited by GPT-4 token limits (~8K tokens)
- **Voice Chat**: Limited by Vapi plan limits and 11Labs character usage

#### Performance Optimizations
