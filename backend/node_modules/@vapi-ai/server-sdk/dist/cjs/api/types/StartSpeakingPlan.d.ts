     * This is how long assistant waits before speaking. Defaults to 0.4.

     * This is the minimum it will wait but if there is latency is the pipeline, this minimum will be exceeded. This is intended as a stopgap in case the pipeline is moving too fast.
     *
     * Example:
     * - If model generates tokens and voice generates bytes within 100ms, the pipeline still waits 300ms before outputting speech.
     *
     * Usage:
     * - If the customer is taking long pauses, set this to a higher value.
     * - If the assistant is accidentally jumping in too much, set this to a higher value.

     * Usage:
     * - If you have yes/no questions like "are you interested in a loan?", you can set a shorter timeout.
     * - If you have questions where the customer may pause to look up information like "what's my account number?", you can set a longer timeout.

     * These rules have the highest precedence and will override both `smartEndpointingPlan` and `transcriptionEndpointingPlan` when a rule is matched.
